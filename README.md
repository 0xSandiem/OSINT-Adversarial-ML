# OSINT-Driven Adversarial Attacks on Misconfigured ML Systems

 **WARNING: FOR EDUCATIONAL AND DEFENSIVE SECURITY PURPOSES ONLY**

This project demonstrates how Open Source Intelligence (OSINT) techniques can be used to discover and exploit misconfigured machine learning systems, and how to defend against such attacks.

##  Purpose

This demonstration is designed for:
- **Educational purposes** in security research and ML security courses
- **Defensive security analysis** to understand attack vectors
- **Security awareness** for ML practitioners and organizations
- **Testing on systems you OWN** or have explicit permission to test

**DO NOT** use this for unauthorized access, malicious attacks, or any illegal activities.

##  Installation

### Prerequisites
- Python 3.8 or higher
- pip package manager
- At least 4GB RAM (for TensorFlow)
- ~500MB disk space

### Setup

1. **Clone or navigate to the project directory:**
   ```bash
   cd ml_osint_security
   ```

2. **Create a virtual environment (recommended):**
   ```bash
   python -m venv venv
   source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows: venv\Scripts\activate
   ```

3. **Install dependencies:**
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

##  Usage

### Quick Start: Full Demonstration

**Option 1: Without Model Extraction (Default)**

Run the complete demonstration (skips Step 4 - model extraction):

```bash
python main.py --full
```

**Expected runtime:** ~40-60 seconds

**Option 2: With Model Extraction (Requires API Server)**

For the complete attack chain including model extraction:

**Terminal 1: Start API Server**
```bash
python vulnerable_system/api_server.py
```

**Terminal 2: Run Full Demo**
```bash
python main.py --full --with-api-attacks
```

**Expected runtime:** ~90-120 seconds

This will:
1.  Set up a vulnerable ML system (MNIST classifier)
2.  Perform OSINT discovery of exposed resources
3.  Execute data poisoning attack (25% poison rate)
4.  **Execute model extraction attack** (1000 API queries)
5.  Generate adversarial examples (FGSM)
6.  Demonstrate defense framework
7.  Collect metrics and generate visualizations

### Run Individual Steps

```bash
# Step 1: Setup vulnerable system
python main.py --step 1

# Step 2: OSINT discovery
python main.py --step 2

# Step 3: Data poisoning attack
python main.py --step 3

# Step 4: Model extraction (requires API server)
python main.py --step 4

# Step 5: Adversarial evasion
python main.py --step 5

# Step 6: Defense framework
python main.py --step 6

# Step 7: Metrics and visualization
python main.py --step 7
```

##  Conclusion

This demonstration shows how seemingly small misconfigurations can be discovered via OSINT and exploited to compromise ML systems. The key takeaways:

1. **Security is critical** for ML systems
