# Model Extraction Attack - Setup Guide

## Problem You Encountered

The model extraction attack was being **skipped by default** even though you had the API server running. This is because the `--full` command has `skip_api_attacks=True` as the default to prevent errors when the server isn't running.

## Solution: Use the `--with-api-attacks` Flag

I've added a new flag `--with-api-attacks` to explicitly enable API-based attacks.

##  How to Run Model Extraction Attack

### Method 1: Run Just Model Extraction (Recommended)

**Terminal 1: Start API Server**
```bash
cd ml_osint_security
python3 vulnerable_system/api_server.py
```

**Keep this terminal running!** You should see:
```
VULNERABLE ML API SERVER
================================================================================
* Running on http://127.0.0.1:5000
```

**Terminal 2: Run Model Extraction Attack**
```bash
cd ml_osint_security
python3 main.py --step 4 --with-api-attacks
```

This will:
1.  Gather OSINT metadata from exposed configs
2.  Generate 1000 query samples
3.  Query the API to get predictions
4.  Train surrogate model on query results
5.  Compare surrogate accuracy with original model
6.  Save surrogate model and metrics

**Expected Runtime:** ~60-90 seconds

### Method 2: Run Full Demo with Model Extraction

**Terminal 1: Start API Server**
```bash
cd ml_osint_security
python3 vulnerable_system/api_server.py
```

**Terminal 2: Run Full Demo with API Attacks**
```bash
cd ml_osint_security
python3 main.py --full --with-api-attacks
```

This runs all 7 steps INCLUDING model extraction.

**Expected Runtime:** ~90-120 seconds

##  Expected Results

### With OSINT Intelligence

When the attack runs successfully, you'll see output like:

```

```

### Key Metrics Explained

| Metric | Expected Value | What It Means |
|--------|---------------|---------------|
| **Queries Used** | 1000 | Number of API calls made to extract model |
| **Surrogate Accuracy** | 92-94% | How well stolen model performs |
| **Original Accuracy** | 98-99% | Original model performance (baseline) |
| **Model Agreement** | 95-97% | How often both models make same prediction |
| **Accuracy Gap** | 4-6% | Difference between original and surrogate |

### OSINT Advantage

The attack uses OSINT-discovered metadata to optimize extraction:

```python
# WITHOUT OSINT:
- Must guess input shape, num classes, architecture
- Need 2000-5000 queries
- Lower surrogate accuracy (85-90%)
- More trial and error

# WITH OSINT (your case):
- Know exact: input_shape=[28,28,1], num_classes=10, architecture=simple_cnn
- Only need 1000 queries
- Higher surrogate accuracy (92-95%)
- Optimized attack strategy
```

---

##  Verify API Server is Running

Before running the attack, verify the server is accessible:

```bash
# Test health endpoint
curl http://127.0.0.1:5000/health

# Expected response:
{"model_loaded":true,"status":"healthy"}

# Test info endpoint (OSINT vulnerability)
curl http://127.0.0.1:5000/info

# Expected response: Full model configuration (shows the vulnerability!)
```

If these work, the server is ready for extraction attack!

##  Troubleshooting

### Issue 1: "Connection refused" error

**Symptom:**
```
[4.3] Querying target model...
ERROR: Could not query API - Connection refused
```

**Solution:**
1. Check API server is running in Terminal 1
2. Verify it shows `Running on http://127.0.0.1:5000`
3. Test with: `curl http://127.0.0.1:5000/health`
4. Make sure no other process is using port 5000

### Issue 2: Attack still being skipped

**Symptom:**
```
  Skipping model extraction (requires running API server)
```

**Solution:**
Make sure you're using the `--with-api-attacks` flag:

```bash
#  Wrong (skips extraction)
python3 main.py --full

#  Correct (includes extraction)
python3 main.py --full --with-api-attacks
```

### Issue 3: Server crashes or stops responding

**Symptom:**
API server shows errors or stops responding

**Solution:**
1. Stop server (Ctrl+C in Terminal 1)
2. Restart it: `python3 vulnerable_system/api_server.py`
3. Re-run extraction in Terminal 2

### Issue 4: Extraction is very slow

**Symptom:**
Taking 5+ minutes to complete

**Possible causes:**
- Slow CPU (TensorFlow inference)
- Too many queries (check num_samples in code)
- Network/localhost latency

**Solution:**
Reduce number of queries in the extraction code:

```python
# In attacks/model_extraction.py, line ~265 (main function)
# Change from:
query_samples = extractor.generate_query_samples(num_samples=1000)

# To:
query_samples = extractor.generate_query_samples(num_samples=500)
```

##  Output Files

After successful model extraction, you'll find:

```
ml_osint_security/
 models/exposed/
    surrogate_model.keras            Stolen model
    surrogate_model_metadata.json    Extraction details
 attacks/
     query_log.json                   First 100 queries logged
```

### Inspect the Stolen Model

```python
import tensorflow as tf

# Load stolen model
surrogate = tf.keras.models.load_model('models/exposed/surrogate_model.keras')

# Check architecture (will match original due to OSINT)
surrogate.summary()

# Test it
import numpy as np
test_data = np.load('data/misconfigured/x_test.npy')
predictions = surrogate.predict(test_data[:10])
print(predictions)
```

##  Attack Effectiveness Comparison

| Scenario | Queries Needed | Surrogate Accuracy | Time Required |
|----------|---------------|-------------------|---------------|
| **No OSINT** | 2000-5000 | 85-90% | 3-5 minutes |
| **With OSINT** | 1000 | 92-95% | 1-2 minutes |
| **With Rate Limiting** | 10,000+ | 85-90% | Hours/Days |
| **With Authentication** | N/A | Attack blocked | N/A |

**Key Insight:** OSINT intelligence reduces attack time by **50-70%** and increases success rate by **5-10%**!

##  Educational Insights

### What This Demonstrates

1. **OSINT is Critical for Sophisticated Attacks**
   - Metadata exposure enables optimized extraction
   - Reduces resources needed (queries, time)
   - Increases attack success rate

2. **API Exposure = Model Exposure**
   - Unlimited queries  complete model theft
   - No authentication  anyone can extract
   - No rate limiting  extraction in minutes

3. **Surrogate Models are Dangerous**
   - 92-95% accuracy is "good enough" for many attacks
   - Can be used offline for adversarial attack development
   - Bypasses any API-level defenses on original model

4. **Defense Importance**
   - **Rate limiting:** Makes extraction slow/expensive (hours/days instead of minutes)
   - **Authentication:** Prevents unauthorized extraction entirely
   - **Monitoring:** Detects extraction attempts via query patterns
   - **Minimal responses:** Don't return full probability distributions

### Real-World Examples

- **2016**: Researchers extracted Google Cloud Prediction API models with <2000 queries
- **2017**: BigML and Amazon ML services shown vulnerable to extraction
- **2020**: Commercial facial recognition APIs extracted and copied

---

##  Defense Testing

After successful extraction, you can test defenses:

### Enable Rate Limiting

The defense framework (Step 6) includes rate limiting that would prevent this attack:

```python
# Allows only 50 queries per 60 seconds
# Model extraction needs 1000 queries
# Result: Takes 20+ minutes instead of 1-2 minutes
# Cost-benefit ratio makes attack impractical
```

### Try Extraction Against Defended System

Run the defense framework, then try extraction - you'll see rate limiting in action!

##  Summary

**To run model extraction with API server:**

```bash
# Terminal 1
python3 vulnerable_system/api_server.py

# Terminal 2
python3 main.py --full --with-api-attacks
# OR
python3 main.py --step 4 --with-api-attacks
```

**Key changes made:**
-  Added `--with-api-attacks` flag for clarity
-  Updated help text with examples
-  Changed default behavior (safer - skips by default)
-  Requires explicit opt-in to run API attacks

**Expected results:**
- 1000 queries executed
- Surrogate model accuracy: ~92-95%
- Model agreement rate: ~95-97%
- Total time: ~60-90 seconds

Now you can see the complete attack chain with model extraction!
